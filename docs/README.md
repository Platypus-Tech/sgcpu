# sgcpu docs
First of all, if you are reading this, is because it turns out people actually care a bit about sgcpu and want to learn about it! That aside, lemme explain how this is organized:

We have a tiny file explaining each individual topic or feature with great detail, from concepts and arch design to coding and timing, and we recommend you to read them in the following order for ease to understand it:
- design.md(not finished)
- asm.md(not started)
- video.md(not started)
- serial.md(not started)
