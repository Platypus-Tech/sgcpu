# 1. sgcpu design

sgcpu is a 16-bit CPU with the ability of addressing up to 64 KiB of memory, and has been inspired by Motorola's MC6809 and Intel's i8086 designs. As I plan on building it in real life, the CPU has been designed having in mind the limitations of what you can do with some PCBs and a very limited budget, while still being fully able of doing regular computer tasks and providing basic keyboard, serial, SD and VGA capabilities.
